# Jupyter Docker Stacks

Jupyter Docker Stacks are a set of ready-to-run [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/jupyter)
containing Jupyter applications and interactive computing tools.

This is a fork of the original docker stacks from Jupyter, adapted to Fermilab/CMS Grid computing needs. Includes xrootd/hadoop integrations and OSG tools such as voms-proxy-** commands and basic OSG worker node software.

## Quick Start

You can try a
[recent build of the jupyter/base-notebook image on mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter/docker-stacks/master?filepath=README.ipynb)
by simply clicking the preceding link. Otherwise, the two examples below may help you get started if
you [have Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) know
[which Docker image](http://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) you
want to use, and want to launch a single Jupyter Notebook server in a container.

The [User Guide on ReadTheDocs](http://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/) describes additional
uses and features in detail.

**Example 1:** This command pulls the `jupyter/scipy-notebook` image tagged `17aba6048f44` from
Docker Hub if it is not already present on the local host. It then starts a container running a
Jupyter Notebook server and exposes the server on host port 8888. The server logs appear in the
terminal. Visiting `http://<hostname>:8888/?token=<token>` in a browser loads the Jupyter Notebook
dashboard page, where `hostname` is the name of the computer running docker and `token` is the
secret token printed in the console. The container remains intact for restart after the notebook
server exits.

    docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook:17aba6048f44

**Example 2:** This command performs the same operations as **Example 1**, but it exposes the server
on host port 10000 instead of port 8888. Visiting `http://<hostname>:10000/?token=<token>` in a
browser loads JupyterLab, where `hostname` is the name of the computer running docker and `token` is
the secret token printed in the console.::

    docker run -p 10000:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook:17aba6048f44

**Example 3:** This command pulls the `jupyter/datascience-notebook` image tagged `9b06df75e445`
from Docker Hub if it is not already present on the local host. It then starts an _ephemeral_
container running a Jupyter Notebook server and exposes the server on host port 10000. The command
mounts the current working directory on the host as `/home/jovyan/work` in the container. The server
logs appear in the terminal. Visiting `http://<hostname>:10000/?token=<token>` in a browser loads
JupyterLab, where `hostname` is the name of the computer running docker and `token` is the secret
token printed in the console. Docker destroys the container after notebook server exit, but any
files written to `~/work` in the container remain intact on the host.

    docker run --rm -p 10000:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan/work jupyter/datascience-notebook:9b06df75e445
